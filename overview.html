                <h3>Instrument interpretation and building pay conditions</h3>
                <p>Tanda PaySure’s payroll calculator works by applying pay conditions from an award or enterprise agreement (e.g. base rates, overtime, loadings, etc.) to an employee’s timesheets. You can use our library of built-in template award pay conditions, or your custom award or enterprise agreement can be built into the payroll calculator.</p>

                <h3>Upload your employee profiles, rosters and timesheets</h3>
                <p>We then upload into the payroll calculator the employee profiles (e.g. commencement date, date of birth and classification) and timesheets that you want a report on.</p>

                <h3>Calculate and report!</h3>
                <p>Once all of the relevant data is uploaded, the payroll calculator will calculate the pay values for each employee. This data can be reported on a pay cycle by pay cycle basis.</p>
